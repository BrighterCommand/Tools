Navigate to Brighter\brightmntr

If you don't have env or cfg directores in brightmntr then run the following at the project root
virtualenv env

Once you have used virtualenv to create a virtual environment you need to activate it

.\env\Scripts\activate.bat

You then need to install some dependencies using the python package manager

pip install kombu
pip install docopt

then you can run the project

python -m brightmntr to run the code
